Since there are no missing values in the Pokémon battle-related numerical values, but there may be missing values in other related numerical values (because some information about Pokémon is unknown), it is considered better to save these two directions as two separate documents for data analysis.
1.In order to analyze the battle ability of each Pokémon, we only need the attack multiplier of the Pokémon for each attribute and various battle numerical values. Therefore, we extract these and save them as the battle_skill.csv file. During the process, we checked whether there were any missing values among these, and the result was negative. Also, there were no abnormal values, which is normal.
2.In order to analyze the correlation between the base stats of each Pokémon and its potentially related characteristic values, we only extract the base stats, height, weight, and other data and save them as the Pokemon_filtered.csv file. For the convenience of subsequent work, and considering that the number of rows with missing values is small, we deleted the Pokémon with missing values (since it is normal for the weight and height of Pokémon to be exaggerated, we did not perform the outlier processing as done in Joe's code).
3.Considering the possible impact of attributes on the base stats of Pokémon and the battle numerical values that make up the base stats, we separately counted the Pokémon of each attribute and saved their corresponding base stat values such as hp, atk, etc. in the pokemon_types folder.
